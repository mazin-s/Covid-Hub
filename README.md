## Introduction/Inspiration
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human live and presents challenges in public health, food systems, and the economy. Governments and Corporations have responded to the pandemic by providing relief aid and COVID infection data. However the provided information is not centralized as it comes from different sources. We've created a centralized website that consists of a Home Page, About Us tab, a Discussion tab, a map of the covid cases, and a relief form to reduce the abstraction barrier for people.

## What it Does
The Home tab explains the purpose of the website. It also consists of a chat with a BOT to remind people the importance of washing their hands and wearing a mask. The About tab explains the inspiration that went behind the website, how the site works, and how we built it. The Discussion tab is where anyone can make a post, such as how they are feeling after getting COVID-19, or what symptoms they had. The Map tab indicates the confirmed cases, dead, recovered, and last updated times of COVID data in all countries around the world. The Relief Form tab should be filled out for people who need money or food, and this information will get forwarded to governments and/or corporations that are willing to provide help. And the Useful Links tab references other articles or information that should be read by the viewer.

## How we built it:
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Html
- Maps Java Script API by Google to create a map and add markers
- TrackCorona API to get COVID-19 country data
- Firebase to store data submitted in the Relief Form Page
- JQuery to make the bot
